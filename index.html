<p>Here, at the Laundry Sensation Development Dream Emporium House of Website Dev, we have a pretty clear vision of where we want this tech to go. The real question is, where will you take it?</p>

<p>The new wave of innovation that we're riding is why we call ourselves The Wein Machine or The We In Machine. We like to really invest ourselves in what we create. If we receive a negative review, we take it out on a Zach.</p>

<a href="https://isitchristmas.com/">Here's a helpful resource!</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyaJ8eR9tzw">Another useful resource that we really feels embodies our mission as, at the very least, the Web Dev Dept.</a></p>

<p>If you feel as though you really need to know when your laundry is done, you're not alone. We have often seen that there is a need to remove the wet clothes from the machine of washing and transfer them to the evaporation receptacle. Otherwise, we find that we are smelly. Unnaceptable in the modern work environment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we aren't always perfect and remember to schedule a transfer for our laundry. That's where the <strong>Time Squidly</strong> comes in!</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
