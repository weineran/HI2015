<p>Here, at the Laundry Sensation Development Dream Emporium House of Website Dev, we have a pretty clear vision of where we want this tech to go. The real question is, where will you take it?</p>

<p>The new wave of innovation that we're riding is why we call ourselves The Wein Machine or The We In Machine. We like to really invest ourselves in what we create. If we receive a negative review, we take it out on a Zach.</p>

<a href="https://isitchristmas.com/">Here's a helpful resource!</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyaJ8eR9tzw">Another useful resource that we really feels embodies our mission as, at the very least, the Web Dev Dept.</a></p>

<p>If you feel as though you really need to know when your laundry is done, you're not alone. We have often seen that there is a need to remove the wet clothes from the machine of washing and transfer them to the evaporation receptacle. Otherwise, we find that we are smelly. Unnaceptable in the modern work environment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we aren't always perfect and remember to schedule a transfer for our laundry. That's where the <strong>Time Squidly</strong> comes in!</p>

<p>Second unfortunately, our Web Dev Dept. can move faster than the R&D/Rainbow Princess Dept., so this is all we have to offer until there is a viable prototype developed... We named her Squidles!</p>

<p>So, you're probably saying to yourself, "Alright, gang, how are you-a bunch of tiny people wandering around a little box-going to tell me about my laundry. Computers aren't even supposed to get wet!" Well, you're right about one of those things: there are tiny people living in your computer. PSYCH! Computers really aren't supposed to be wet. However, there is another way to detect that your clothes are clean and ready to be shifted to infinity and beyond! Or the dryer...</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I Wanna Get Technical, Technical</h3>

<p>What we offer is a nifty little device that you can place on your washing machine. This doodad will sense when the unit is doing the boogie-AKA the spin cycle. After everything has splished, splashed, and rinsed, that little robot that you affixed to your washer realizes that there's nothing happening anymore! This is information you need to know ASAFP. That way, you can pause your Netflix binge and head on down to the laundry room, past that weird, hanging wire, around the puddle of whoknowswhat, and fish out your mismatching socks to continue the cycle of cycles. As soon as you have the hardware and the software, we can start to send you emails about your underwear! ... Or at least when the washer is done... it may or may not have underwear, we don't really want to know.</p>
